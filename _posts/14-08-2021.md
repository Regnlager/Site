title: Creating Secure Networks for V2X Communications | NXP Semiconductors
---
V2X technology has the potential to drastically reduce road accidents and improve the traffic 
flow by fusing in-car sensor data with data obtained from other road users and from the surrounding infrastructure. 
Vehicle to cloud data communication provides a pathway for anonymous data collection and dissemination, 
meaning it is vital that the authenticity and security of data are guaranteed. 
In addition, the vehicle control units that coordinate active stability systems must be protected against 
external influences that might subvert the mechanism's design. This presentation will explore 
the various security countermeasures needed to make V2X a safe and secure technology for the future.
